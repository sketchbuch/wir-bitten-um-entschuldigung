# 🚝 Wir bitten um Entschuldigung 🚨

An ongoing log of every issue I experience with Deutsche Bahn.

People who have never lived in Germany often cite Germany as a reliable, punctual country where everything runs on time. The truth is, that DB trains are as late, cancelled and delayed as trains in Italy, the UK, or Ireland.

There is nothing magical about german trains, although I will admit that 2nd class on ICE's makes 1st in the UK look like 3rd class, but don't rely on DB to get you where you want to go.
