# üöù Wir bitten um Entschuldigung üö®

An on-going log of every issue I experience with Deutsche Bahn (DB).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who have never lived in Germany often cite it as a reliable, punctual country where everything runs on time. The truth is that DB trains are as late, cancelled, or delayed as trains in Italy, the UK, or Ireland - or anywhere else for that matter.

There is nothing magical about German trains, although I will admit that 2nd class on an ICE makes 1st class in the UK look like 3rd class, but don't rely on DB to get you where you want to go.

I only started making notes in 2023 so all my journeys before I can't document. I would estimate that less than 5% of my travels have actually been on time and without incident.

I didn't travel very much this year, but due to the Deutschland-Ticket I have been travelling a lot on local trains rather than long distance ones.

### 24th of December - Conductor Scroodge

*Stendal to Leipzig*

The train was nearly on time, but again a threat was made to stop at Magdeburg if people kept smoking in the toilets.

This was exactly the same train that had this issue before. The conductor, who was full of Christmas cheer, said if it happens again he will call the Police, and the Fire Brigade at Magdeburg and it will be a 2 hour delay and no one would get home.

This was Christmas Eve, the conductor would make Charles Dickens proud. Bah, Humbug!

Just like on the previous occassion there was no evidence of any smoking, just shoddy old trains which probably have defective smoke detectors. Or the conductor just likes demonstrating his power and enjoys scaring the old people travelling on the train.

Eventually made it Leipzig about 5 minutes lat due to stopping to let other trains past.

### 18th of December - Idiot decides to drive across the railway tracks

*Leipzig to Uchtspringer*

Another day, another disappointing DB journey that began at 5am, so that I could get the 7am train that I needed.

Whilst travelling between Leipzig and Uchtspringer via Stendal and Magdeburg, I managed to make it as far as Dessau before the train ground to a halt at Platform 1.

At first no information was given but after a while the DB App and the announcements at Dessau conceded that the issue was a car on the line between Dessau and G√ºtergl√ºck and that no trains would be going anywhere.

This is after keeping everyone on the train waiting for 20 minutes. I had to go back to Leipzig, which took a while as the trains to Leipzig were also delayed. I waited for the next train to leipzig, I had missed one as the train I arrived on when back to Leipzig 5 minutes after they told everyone to get off.

I was waiting on a second Regional Express (RE) that had arrived from Leipzig - either it would go back to Leipzig as well or it would go on to Magdeburg - both were fine for me.

After 20 minutes of waiting again still no announcement. An S-Bahn was leaving on Platform 3, should I swap trains? I decide it will be back in Leipzig before this one and make my way there. 3 minutes after getting to the S-Bahn, there was an announcement that we should all get out if we want to travel to Leipzig and travel on the RE on platform 1 - the train I had previously waited over 20 minutes on.

After everyone ran to platfrom 1 to board the RE, we discovered that all the people on the RE wanted to go Magdeburg and had no idea that the train was going back to Leipzig - there had been no announcement on their train at this point.

No one on the RE knew if they should get off, no one from the S-Bahn knew if they should get on as the displays still showed Magdeburg as the destination.

Communication seems to be non-existent between DB personnel and trains. Eventually the announcement was made and all the people that were hoping for Magdeburg finally alighted and we could proceed back to Leipzig.

Having missed a hospital appointment in Uchtspringer I eventually made it back to Leipzig about 10:40 in time for brunch at a cafe.

*Warnem√ºnde - Leipzig*

I was on holiday in Warnem√ºnder with my Partner, and on the way back - about 200m from Rostock Main Station - our train stopped.

After a while we got told that a Bomb had been unearthed near Rostock Station and that we would have to go back to Warnem√ºnde.

On the way back we got told by conductors that (in english and german) about the bomb and that there would be busses waiting for us. I told my partner not to get her hopes up.

We arrived back at Warnem√ºnde to find that there was no trains any more, there was also no bus like we had been told - what a shocker!

An old german woman was complaining to DB employees and asking where the bus was - they said they had no idea and carried on smoking and talking about what they were going to do after work.

Everyone on the train was left to get to Rostock by themselves - DB gave no information except to say that the bomb disposal squad was coming from Schwerin and it would take several hours.

We had booked first class on ICE's from Warnem√ºnde to Berlin and then from Berlin to Leipzig.

Now we had to travel by boat to Rostock as this was the only possibility. After 30 minutes of waiting and 2 hours of sailing we made it to find that there were trains still leaving Rostock. The only one we could find was an IC 2nd class.

It was delayed and during the trip to Berlin we heard on the news that the bomb wasn't a bomb... What was going to be about 3.5 hours in 1st class turned out to be about 7 hours on a boat, an IC and then an ICE to Leipzig.

A typical day travelling with trains through germany thanks to DB and a piece of piping dug up by builders.
