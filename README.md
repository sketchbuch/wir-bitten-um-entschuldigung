An ongoing log of every issue I experience with Deutsche Bahn (DB).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People who have never lived in Germany often cite it as a reliable, punctual country where everything runs on time. The truth is that DB trains are as late, cancelled, or delayed as trains in Italy, the UK, or Ireland - or anywhere else for that matter.

There is nothing magical about German trains, although I will admit that 2nd class on an ICE makes 1st class in the UK look like 3rd class, but don't rely on DB to get you where you want to go.

Another day, another disappointing DB journey that began at 5am, so that I could get the 7am train that I needed.

Whilst travelling between Leipzig and Uchtspringer via Stendal and Magdeburg, I managed to make it as far as Dessau before the train ground to a halt at Platform 1

At first no information was given but after a while the DB app and the announcements at Dessau conceded that the issue was a car on the line between Dessau and G√ºtergl√ºck and that no trains would be going anywhere.

This is after keeping everyone on the train waiting for 20 minutes. I had to go back to Leipzig, which took a while as the trains to Leipzig were also delayed. I waited for the next train to leipzig, I had missed one as the train I arrived on when back to Leipzig 5 minutes after they told evryone to get off.

I was waiting on a second Regional Express (RE) that had arrived from Leipzig - either it would go back to Leipzig as well or it would go on to Magdeburg - both were fine for me.

After 20 minutes of waiting again still no announcement. An S-Bahn was leaving on Platform 3, should I swap trains? I decide it will be back in Leipzig before this one and make my way there. 3 minutes after getting to the S-Bahn, there was an announcement that we should all get out if we want to travel to Leipzig and travel obn the RE on platform 1 - the train I had previously waited over 20 minutes on.

After everyone ran to platfrom 1 to board the RE, we discovered that all the people on the RE wanted to go Magdeburg and had no idea that the train was going back to Leipzig - there had been no annocouncement at thi spoint to them.

No one on the RE knew if they should get off, no one from the S-Bahn knew if they should get on as the dsiplays still showed Magdeburg as the destination.

Communication seems to be non-existent between DB personnel and trains. Eventually the announcement was made and all the people that were hoping for Magdeburg find alighted and we could proceed back to Leipzig.

Having missed a hospital appointment in Uchtspringer I eventually made it back to Leipzig about 10:40 in time for brunch at a cafe.
